After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

	https://young-oasis-18653.herokuapp.com/addBook

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

	https://github.com/ploien/cse341-project/tree/main/prove02

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

	The GET and POST pages are executed correctly. EJS is used to send variables between pages
	but no styles have been added.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

	No styles have been added so it doesn't look nice. The book title and summary aren't saved once the session ends.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

	The coolest thing I learned was how to use templateing engines.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

	Since the page do what they are supposed to, but haven't had any styles added to them, and nothing from the session is saved,
	3 seems appropriate.
